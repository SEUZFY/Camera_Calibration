## HOW TO USE

* Clone this project at: https://github.com/SEUZFY/Camera_Calibration.git

* Or download the code and open the [CMakeLists.txt](https://github.com/SEUZFY/Camera_Calibration/blob/master/CMakeLists.txt) file in an IDE.

Build and run this project, a viewer as shown above should pop up automatically, press `space` and select one of the `.txt` files to calibrate.

**Note**: `.txt` files are available in the [data](https://github.com/SEUZFY/Camera_Calibration/tree/master/resources/data) folder.

After calibration, press `t` to show the calibrated virtual camera (in blue frame), as shown below:
